# foyer
A new Flutter project.

To run Foyer, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to store the project. Then run the following command to clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```
   Replace `<repository_url>` with the URL of the GitHub repository.

2. Navigate to the project directory: Change your directory to the cloned repository's location:
   ```
   cd <repository_directory>
   ```
   Replace `<repository_directory>` with the name of the directory where the repository was cloned.

3. Install dependencies: Flutter projects rely on various dependencies and packages. To install them, use the following command:
   ```
   flutter pub get
   ```

4. Connect a device or emulator: Make sure you have a physical device connected via USB or an emulator running. You can check the available devices by running:
   ```
   flutter devices
   ```

5. Run the project: To run the Flutter project, execute the following command:
   ```
   flutter run
   ```

   This command will build the project and deploy it to the connected device or can use F5 to RUN.

Make sure you have Flutter SDK installed and properly configured before attempting these steps. Also, ensure that your development environment meets the project's specific requirements, such as the Flutter SDK version and any additional dependencies mentioned in the project's documentation or README file.

Note: If the project's README file provides any specific instructions or commands, make sure to follow those as well.
